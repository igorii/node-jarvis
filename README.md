node-jarvis
===========

Inspired by cranklin's php Jarvis project, http://cranklin.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/building-my-own-siri-jarvis/.

This project will either use node.js as a console-esque Jarvis application, or as a web server to serve a web-based Jarvis application for the network.

Plans:
1) Speech to text
2) Query some knowledge base (wolfram alpha/ evi, etc)
3) Turn response into text to speech
4) Extend with personal applications (calendar, todo, etc)
5) Extend with webcam and face recognition for greeting when entering room
